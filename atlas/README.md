# aspire-si: how it works

Mapped at 2026-10-07 from commit ddf58ce by Atlas 1.24.0.

## What this is

ASPIRE training system (student, critic, teachers) with a training-dynamics export for ScalarScope (written by a person)

8 parts, mostly Python (141 files), shell (3), CSS (2), TypeScript (2), Astro (1) and JavaScript (1). Work enters through 4 doors; the busiest is CI, which reaches 4 parts. It publishes to PyPI. It deploys a site to GitHub Pages. People run aspire.

## What changed since 2026-10-07 (1cd5353)

- tests now imports examples.
- examples/sft-experiment/ is now read by tests/test_sft_experiment.py.
- 8 files added and 1 changed content, across 3 parts.

## What comes in

1. **CI.** On a pull request to main touching 7 paths; on a push to main touching 7 paths; or by hand. Runs examples/geometry_demo.py and tests/; checks aspire/ and integrations/.
2. **Release to PyPI.** When a release is published. Checks aspire/ and integrations/.
3. **Deploy site to GitHub Pages.** On a push to main touching 2 paths; or by hand. Runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/.
4. **aspire** (a command people run). Runs aspire/cli.py.

## What happens through CI

1. The workflow runs examples/geometry_demo.py in examples and tests/ in tests; it checks aspire/ in aspire and integrations/ in integrations.
   1. Inside examples/geometry_demo.py, `main` does, in order: `GeometryRecorder` (aspire) and `record_step` (GeometryRecorder).
2. It uploads coverage to Codecov.

## Who reads the results

CI writes nothing this map can see.

## The other doors

**Release to PyPI** checks aspire/ and integrations/, and publishes to PyPI.

**Deploy site to GitHub Pages** runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/, and deploys the site.

**aspire** (a command people run) runs aspire/cli.py.

## What breaks what

- **aspire** is imported by 1 part (examples), and by 1 more only from tests; it sits on the path of 3 doors.
- **integrations** is imported only from tests, by 1 part (tests), and sits on the path of 2 doors.
- **examples** is imported only from tests, by 1 part (tests), and sits on the path of 1 door.

## What tends to change together

No two source files changed together often enough to name.

Window: 180 days; a pair counts from 3 shared commits, since the window holds fewer than 30 qualifying commits.

## What no test touches

Every code part is imported by at least one test.

## Written but never read

No place this map can see is written, so none goes unread.

## Helpers that look duplicated

No two parts export a helper that looks alike.

## Generated, never hand-edited

Nothing in this repository writes to a tracked place this map can see.

## Hand-authored

People write .github/, docs/, the repository root and site/; 3 writes with paths built at run time may land here.

## Where to start

.github/workflows/ci.yml → examples/geometry_demo.py → aspire/geometry.py

Read those in order to follow one pull request end to end.

## What this map cannot see

- 3 import sites name a declared dependency that shares its name with a local module (openai); they are read as the dependency, which is not in this repository.
- 2 imports could not be resolved: `aspire/cli.py` imports a path built at run time; `tests/test_cli_errors.py` imports a path built at run time.
- 3 writes and 13 reads use paths built at run time and are not named here.
- 17 writes and 29 reads go to a path their caller passes, not to this repository.
- 1 read goes to the home directory (.cache/), not to this repository.
- Statistics confidence is low: fewer than 30 qualifying commits in the window, and fewer than 25 source files reach 10 revisions.
